
Authorization and CORS
 

Authorization

	The HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server, usually, but not necessarily, after the server has responded with a 401 Unauthorized status and the WWW-Authenticate header.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

	CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. 
	A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts
	For example, web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.
	The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. Modern browsers use CORS in APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to mitigate the risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.
	The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information from a web browser.
